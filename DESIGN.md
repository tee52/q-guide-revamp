## Problems with the Original Q Guide

There are several issues with the current Q Guide that I wanted to fix:
- clunky layout
- inconsistent visual identity
- lack of information on courses
- scores reported on separate pages from courses
- search by only two criteria (course and instructor)
- irrelevant information presented on pages with scores
